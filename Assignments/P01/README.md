## 📦 Convex Hull Algorithms: Graham Scan, Jarvis March, and QuickHull

### 🎯 Purpose

This project explores **Convex Hull algorithms**, which are essential tools in computational geometry. A **Convex Hull** is the smallest convex polygon that contains all given points in a set. You can think of it like stretching a rubber band around the outermost points—it "hugs" the dataset tightly.

We focus on three core algorithms:
- **Graham Scan**
- **Jarvis March (Gift Wrapping)**
- **QuickHull**

These algorithms are fundamental for understanding spatial computation and have diverse applications in fields like computer graphics, robotics, and more.

### ✨ Why It’s Interesting

Convex Hulls are the foundation for many geometric operations:
- Collision detection in gaming
- Pathfinding in robotics
- Pattern recognition in AI
- Shape analysis in computer vision
- Data clustering and outlier detection

Understanding how Convex Hulls are constructed sheds light on broader concepts like **divide-and-conquer**, **greedy methods**, and **geometric sorting**.

### 📚 Summary

- **Graham Scan**: Best general-purpose method, uses sorting
- **Jarvis March**: Simple, great when few hull points
- **QuickHull**: Fast in practice, uses divide-and-conquer

Understanding these three algorithms gives insight into algorithmic thinking and prepares us for more advanced geometric or spatial problems.

### 📎 Neat Facts about Convex Hulls

- 🧲 **Rubber Band Analogy:** If you imagine stretching a rubber band around a set of pushpins on a board, the rubber band naturally forms the convex hull—no math needed!

- 🪢 **Convex Hull of 2D Points is Also Used in 3D:** While this project focuses on 2D, the same principles extend to 3D, where convex hulls form **convex polyhedra**—used in 3D modeling and physics engines.

- 🧮 **Small Change, Big Difference:** Adding just one point to a dataset can drastically change the convex hull shape if it's far enough from the current boundary.

- 🔁 **Rotating Calipers:** After building a convex hull, you can use a method called **Rotating Calipers** to find:
  - The diameter of a set of points
  - The smallest bounding box
  - Closest or farthest pair of points on the hull

- 🧠 **Linked to Machine Learning:** Convex hulls are foundational in **support vector machines (SVMs)**, where the goal is to separate convex regions in feature space.

- 📦 **Convex Hull Trick in DP:** There’s even something called the *Convex Hull Trick* in competitive programming and dynamic programming to optimize certain classes of problems.

- 🧊 **3D Convex Hulls Help Simulate Melting Ice!** Scientists simulate physical shapes (like melting icebergs) by calculating convex hulls at different time steps in 3D.

**Fun Bonus Challenge:**  
Can you think of a real-life situation where a convex hull naturally forms? (Hint: Think pizza delivery zones, or animal migration tracking!)
